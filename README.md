## Repository Structure
JCompare.jar is the application file. This can be downloaded separately from the rest of the repository and function normally. The JAR contains all the required dependencies; the only requirement to run the jar in JRE 8+.

The documentation folder contains information on the project, including the the user manual, javadoc, and a copy of the final report submitted for the capstone project.

The examples folder contains some test case files that can be used with the system for experimentation.

The src folder contains all the source code for the project, from which the javadoc and JCompare.jar are generated.

config.json is the configuration file used by the JCompare application. This is not necessary to download along with the applicaiton. The application will generate a copy of this file in whatever directory it is placed when run for the first time.

pom.xml is the maven pom for this project.

## Branches
There are two main branches in the repository. Master contains the most up to date version of the software and documentation. Minimum-Viable-Product is a copy of the repository at the time of the project presentation during the capstone project, approximately half way through the life of the project.

## Note
We recognize that there may be other projects/applications named 'JCompare'. This is a working title for the project and the project is not affiliated with any other project or organization outside of this repository that is also named 'JCompare'.
